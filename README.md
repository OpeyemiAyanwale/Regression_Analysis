# Regression_Analysis
- Examine the relationship between the dependent (response) and independent (explanatory) variables
- Select a suitable subset of independent variables for the best subset model
- Evaluate the model, create a residual plot and
- Examine it for patterns of linearity, heteroskedasticity, and normality
- The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to test for multicollinearity
